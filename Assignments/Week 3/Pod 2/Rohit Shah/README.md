# DVOTE - SMARTPY FrontEnd

Actual Code - [dvote-smartpy](https://github.com/RohitShah1706/TezIndia-BuilderCamp-1.0/tree/main/Assignments/Week%202/Pod%202/RohitShah)  
Contract deployed in GhostNet - [dvote-bcd](https://better-call.dev/ghostnet/KT1UjRJ4WnDcPUKZmkDjUav9Y2qhBBKv4rfe/operations)  
FrontEnd deployed here - [DVOTE](https://dvote-1706.netlify.app)

This dapp allows admin to register themselves as authority for conducting an election.  
The authority then can add candidates and voters and conduct an election. Once election is  
finished the results are delcared.  
The votes pushed are immutable and so the election process becomes much more secure, immutable and safe.  
The integration is done using Taquito with the smartpy contract deployed on ghostnet.

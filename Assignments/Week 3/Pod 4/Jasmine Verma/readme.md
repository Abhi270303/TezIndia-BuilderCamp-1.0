# Randomized Voting System Readme

This project is a randomized voting system built using SmartPy and integrated with Taquito and Node.js for wallet and smart contract integration. Here are the links to the contract and UI:

## How it works

The platform allows users to vote on a set of proposals in a randomized manner. Here's a brief overview of how the platform works:

1. The user connects their wallet to the platform.
2. The user selects the proposal they want to vote for.
3. The platform randomly selects a group of voters from a larger pool.
4. The user's vote is added to the pool of votes.
5. The platform tallies the votes and determines the winner.

## Features

The platform has the following features:

- Randomized voting: The platform selects a group of voters at random to ensure fairness and prevent collusion.
- Multiple proposals: The platform allows for multiple proposals to be voted on.
- Wallet integration: The platform integrates with wallets using Taquito and Node.js.

## Technologies Used

The platform is built using the following technologies:

- SmartPy: The smart contract is written in SmartPy.
- Taquito: Taquito is used to integrate the wallet and smart contract.
- Node.js: Node.js is used for server-side scripting.
- React.js: The user interface is built using React.js.

## Getting Started

To run the platform locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the application using `npm start`.

## Conclusion

This is a randomized voting system that allows users to vote on proposals in a fair and randomized manner. The platform uses SmartPy for the smart contract and integrates with wallets using Taquito and Node.js. The user interface is built using React.js.
